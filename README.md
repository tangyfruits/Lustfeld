This is my first LUA-based World of Warcraft AddOn. It simply plays the Seinfeld theme when Bloodlust/Timewarp is successfully applied as a buff. It currently only supports Horde lusts ~~but I plan to implement a table for tidiness for Alliance too.~~ COMPLETED Lustfeld reads from the combat log to check if Lust is cast, this iteration of the combat log especially in a large raid environment might be challenging for older computers.
